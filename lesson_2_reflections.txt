1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	- When i initial a new repository a '.git' directory is created with no commits.
	  When running 'git status' it says that there is only an 'Initial commit'.
	- I need to do it to create n new repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
   What value do you think it offers?

   - The staging area stores all information about what will change with the next commit.
   - Staging areas allows to add several files/changes to the repository/working directoroy with
     one commit.    

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	- First run 'git diff' command to compare the working directory with the staging area.
	  Next run 'git diff --staged' to compare the staging area with the most recent commit.
